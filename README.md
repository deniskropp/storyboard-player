# Storyboard Player

The Storyboard Player is a tool designed to process and visualize storyboard files written in Markdown. It supports various functionalities such as displaying the storyboard in the console, rendering it in a GUI window, generating a QML file for a graphical user interface, and rendering the storyboard to a video file.

## Features

- **Display in Console**: View the storyboard content directly in the console.
- **Display in GUI**: Visualize the storyboard in a graphical user interface window.
- **Generate QML**: Create a QML file that can be used to display the storyboard in a QML viewer.
- **Render to Video**: Convert the storyboard into a video file.

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

- `filename`: The path to the storyboard markdown file.
- `--display`: Display the storyboard in the console.
- `--display_gui`: Display the storyboard in a GUI window.
- `--display_qml`: Generate and display the storyboard in a QML viewer.
- `--render_video`: Render the storyboard to a video file.
- `--output`: The output video filename (default: `output.mp4`).
- `--qml_output`: The output QML filename (default: `storyboard.qml`).

### Example Commands

1. **Display in Console**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --display
   ```

2. **Display in GUI**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --display_gui
   ```

3. **Generate QML**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --display_qml
   ```

4. **Render to Video**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --render_video
   ```

5. **Custom Output Video Filename**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --render_video --output my_video.mp4
   ```

6. **Custom QML Output Filename**:
   ```bash
   python main.py test/test-storyboard.md --display_qml --qml_output my_storyboard.qml
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `markdown`
  - `FreeSimpleGUI`
  - `Pillow`
  - `requests`
  - `torch`
  - `kokoro`
  - `soundfile`
  - `subprocess`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install markdown FreeSimpleGUI Pillow requests torch kokoro soundfile
```

## Configuration

Configuration constants for the storyboard player are defined in the `Config` class within the `storyboard/config.py` file. You can modify these constants to suit your needs.

## Logging

The application uses a custom logger defined in `storyboard/logger.py`. Logs are output to the console by default. You can also configure the logger to write logs to a file by uncommenting the relevant line in the `logger` initialization.

## Directory Structure

- `storyboard/`: Contains the main modules and classes.
- `images/`: Directory for downloaded images.
- `sound/`: Directory for generated sound files.
- `logs/`: Directory for log files (if logging to a file is enabled).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **FFmpeg Not Found**:
   - Ensure that `ffmpeg` is installed and added to your system's PATH.
   - You can download `ffmpeg` from [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. **Kokoro Installation Issues**:
   - Ensure that `kokoro` is installed correctly. You can install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install kokoro
     ```

3. **Image Download Errors**:
   - Ensure that the image URLs in your storyboard file are correct and accessible.
   - Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

4. **Sound Generation Errors**:
   - Ensure that the `kokoro` library is properly installed and configured.
   - Verify that the text-to-speech pipeline is initialized correctly.

### Debugging Tips

- Enable debug logging by setting the logging level to `DEBUG` in the `Logger` class.
- Check the console output for any error messages or warnings.
- Review the log files (if logging to a file is enabled) for more detailed information.
